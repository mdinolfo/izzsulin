# izzsulin

On Thanksgiving 2020, my then four year old daughter was passed out and was hospitalized. She was diagnosed the next day with Type 1 diabeties. It was a major adjustment and an large amount of learning in order to be able to bring her home.

I created this app to help her mother and I calculate the amount of insulin to give her, based on her blood sugar, carbohydrates consumed, and her insulin factor. We tried other apps, but most were made for type 2 diabetics or many bells and whistles. I wanted something easy and clean.

Later, I abandoned this app when I learned of a teenage boy who wrote his own Type 1 diabetic insulin calculator in favor of using and supporting that one.
